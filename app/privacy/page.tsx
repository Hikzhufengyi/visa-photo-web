        <p className="policy-meta">Effective date: May 21, 2026</p>

        <p>
          IDPhoto Pro is designed to help users create passport, visa,
          immigration, green card, residence card, and ID photos while keeping
          photo processing private and local.
        </p>

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>1. Photo Processing</h2>
          <p>
            All photo processing happens on your device. IDPhoto Pro does not
            upload your photos to a server for face detection, cropping,
            background replacement, light repair, compression, export, print
            layout generation, or creation history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Face position, eye line, head proportion, top margin, and similar
            photo checks are performed locally using on-device image analysis.
            IDPhoto Pro does not create, collect, store, or upload face
            templates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Photos may leave the app only when you choose to save them to
            Photos, save them to Files, or share them through the iOS system
            share sheet.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>2. Data We Store Locally</h2>
          <p>IDPhoto Pro may store the following data locally on your device:</p>
          <ul className="policy-list">
            <li>Your local username</li>
            <li>Your local avatar</li>
            <li>Creation records</li>
            <li>
              Exported preview images and export files saved in the app sandbox
            </li>
            <li>App preferences such as onboarding status</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data is used only to provide app features on your device. It
            is not synced to a cloud account by IDPhoto Pro.
          </p>

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>4. Purchases</h2>
          <p>
            IDPhoto Pro may offer a lifetime unlock as a one-time,
            non-consumable in-app purchase through Apple. There is no
            subscription, no recurring charge, and no advertising in the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Purchases are processed by Apple. IDPhoto Pro receives purchase
            entitlement information from StoreKit so the app can unlock paid
            features. We do not receive your payment card information.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can restore a previous purchase in the app. Restore Purchase
            checks your App Store account purchase history through Apple and
            does not upload your photos.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>5. Sharing and Export</h2>
          <p>
            When you save or share an exported photo, JPG, PNG, HEIF, PDF, or
            print layout, your action is handled by iOS system services such as
            Photos, Files, Mail, Messages, AirDrop, or other apps you choose.
            Those services and apps may have their own privacy practices.

        </section>

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>6. Deleting Data</h2>
          <p>
            You can clear local creation records in the app. You can also
            delete the app to remove locally stored app data, subject to iOS
            storage behavior and backups.

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>7. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            IDPhoto Pro is a general utility app. It is not designed to
            knowingly collect personal data from children. Because photo
            processing is local, the app does not send children&apos;s photos to
            our servers.

        </section>

        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2>8. Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            IDPhoto Pro is not affiliated with any government, embassy, visa
            center, or official application portal. The app helps prepare photos
            based on published requirements, but it cannot guarantee acceptance
            by any authority. Users should review the official source before
            submitting final photos.

            Compliance checks are guidance only. Requirements may change, and
